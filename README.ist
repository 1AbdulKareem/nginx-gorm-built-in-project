This project is a part of a (temp private) project. The goal of this project is to maintain The NGINX web server as a TCP/IP hardware proxy that supports printing functionalities over the cloud without touching the network configurations nor firewall.


TO DO ---------

Implementing private keys and public keys to the hardware proxy.
Implementing a modular ARCH for extending the the functionalities for things other than printers.

Thank you for interest in my project.
